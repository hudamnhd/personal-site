## 1. Introduction to Linux

Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system kernel that serves as the foundation for various operating systems. It is widely used for servers, desktops, and embedded systems due to its reliability, flexibility, and security. Many distributions (distros) of Linux are available, such as Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, and Debian.

### Key Points:
- Linux is free and open-source, meaning anyone can use, modify, and distribute it.
- Linux is known for its stability and security, which makes it popular for servers and mission-critical systems.
- The Linux kernel manages system resources, hardware, and software interactions.

## 2. Basic Linux Commands

Linux commands are used to interact with the operating system via the command-line interface (CLI). Here are some essential Linux commands:

### Navigating the Filesystem

- **`pwd`**: Print the current working directory.
  ```bash
  pwd
  ```

- **`ls`**: List the contents of a directory.
  ```bash
  ls
  ls -l  # For detailed listing
  ```

- **`cd`**: Change directory.
  ```bash
  cd /path/to/directory
  cd ~   # Go to home directory
  cd ..  # Go up one directory
  ```

- **`mkdir`**: Create a new directory.
  ```bash
  mkdir new_directory
  ```

- **`rmdir`**: Remove an empty directory.
  ```bash
  rmdir empty_directory
  ```

### File Operations

- **`touch`**: Create a new empty file.
  ```bash
  touch newfile.txt
  ```

- **`cat`**: View the contents of a file.
  ```bash
  cat file.txt
  ```

- **`cp`**: Copy files or directories.
  ```bash
  cp source.txt destination.txt
  cp -r source_directory/ destination_directory/
  ```

- **`mv`**: Move or rename files or directories.
  ```bash
  mv old_name.txt new_name.txt
  mv file.txt /path/to/directory/
  ```

- **`rm`**: Remove files or directories.
  ```bash
  rm file.txt
  rm -r directory/  # Remove directory recursively
  ```

### Viewing and Searching Files

- **`less`**: View the contents of a file, allowing you to scroll.
  ```bash
  less file.txt
  ```

- **`head`**: View the first 10 lines of a file.
  ```bash
  head file.txt
  ```

- **`tail`**: View the last 10 lines of a file.
  ```bash
  tail file.txt
  ```

- **`grep`**: Search for patterns in files.
  ```bash
  grep "pattern" file.txt
  grep -r "pattern" /path/to/directory/  # Search recursively
  ```

## 3. File Permissions

In Linux, file permissions are an important part of system security. Each file and directory has permissions that define who can read, write, or execute the file.

### Understanding File Permissions

- **`r`**: Read permission allows viewing the contents of a file.
- **`w`**: Write permission allows modifying the contents of a file.
- **`x`**: Execute permission allows running the file as a program.

### Viewing File Permissions

Use the **`ls -l`** command to view file permissions.

```bash
ls -l file.txt
```

Output example:
```bash
-rwxr-xr-- 1 user group 0 Jan 1 12:00 file.txt
```
Explanation:
- **`rwx`**: Owner has read, write, and execute permissions.
- **`r-x`**: Group has read and execute permissions.
- **`r--`**: Others have read-only permission.

### Changing File Permissions

- **`chmod`**: Change file permissions.
  ```bash
  chmod +x file.sh  # Add execute permission
  chmod 755 file.sh  # Set permissions (rwxr-xr-x)
  ```

- **`chown`**: Change file owner and group.
  ```bash
  chown user:group file.txt
  ```

- **`chgrp`**: Change the group of a file.
  ```bash
  chgrp group file.txt
  ```

## 4. Processes and System Monitoring

Linux allows you to monitor and manage running processes and system resources.

### Viewing Running Processes

- **`ps`**: Show information about running processes.
  ```bash
  ps aux  # Display all running processes
  ```

- **`top`**: Display real-time system resource usage, including CPU and memory.
  ```bash
  top
  ```

- **`htop`**: An enhanced version of `top` with a more user-friendly interface (requires installation).
  ```bash
  sudo apt install htop
  htop
  ```

- **`kill`**: Terminate a running process.
  ```bash
  kill <PID>  # Kill by process ID
  kill -9 <PID>  # Force kill a process
  ```

### Disk Usage

- **`df`**: Display disk space usage.
  ```bash
  df -h  # Show disk space in human-readable format
  ```

- **`du`**: Display directory space usage.
  ```bash
  du -sh /path/to/directory
  ```

## 5. Networking in Linux

Linux provides several commands to manage and troubleshoot networking.

### Checking Network Configuration

- **`ifconfig`**: Display or configure network interfaces (older command, replaced by `ip` in many systems).
  ```bash
  ifconfig
  ```

- **`ip`**: Display and configure network interfaces.
  ```bash
  ip a  # Display all network interfaces
  ip link set eth0 up  # Enable network interface eth0
  ```

- **`ping`**: Test network connectivity.
  ```bash
  ping google.com
  ```

- **`netstat`**: Display network connections and routing tables.
  ```bash
  netstat -tuln  # List all listening ports
  ```

## 6. Package Management

Linux distributions have package managers that help you install, update, and remove software.

### Debian-based systems (e.g., Ubuntu) use **`apt`**:

- **`apt update`**: Update the package list.
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  ```

- **`apt install`**: Install a package.
  ```bash
  sudo apt install package-name
  ```

- **`apt upgrade`**: Upgrade installed packages.
  ```bash
  sudo apt upgrade
  ```

- **`apt remove`**: Remove a package.
  ```bash
  sudo apt remove package-name
  ```

### Red Hat-based systems (e.g., Fedora) use **`yum`**:

- **`yum install`**: Install a package.
  ```bash
  sudo yum install package-name
  ```

## 7. Conclusion

Linux is a powerful and versatile operating system that is used in various environments, from desktop computing to large-scale server management. By mastering the basics of Linux, such as commands, file permissions, system monitoring, and package management, you can navigate and manage Linux systems efficiently.

Happy coding!
