## 1. Introduction to HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. HTML defines the structure and content of a webpage using a series of elements, which are represented by tags.

### Key Points:
- HTML is used to structure content on the web.
- It is the foundation of web development, along with CSS and JavaScript.
- HTML elements are the building blocks of web pages.

## 2. Basic Structure of an HTML Document

An HTML document has a basic structure, which includes the `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.

### Example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>My Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### Key Points:
- The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration defines the document type and version of HTML.
- The `<html>` tag is the root element of the document.
- The `<head>` tag contains metadata (e.g., title, character set, external resources).
- The `<body>` tag contains the content of the page (e.g., text, images, links).

## 3. HTML Elements and Tags

HTML is composed of elements, which are enclosed in tags. Tags usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag.

### Common HTML Tags:
- `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc.: Headings
- `<p>`: Paragraph
- `<a>`: Link (anchor)
- `<img>`: Image
- `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`: Lists (unordered and ordered)
- `<div>`, `<span>`: Generic container elements

### Example:
```html
<h1>Main Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
<a href="https://www.example.com">Click here</a>
```

## 4. Attributes

HTML elements can have attributes, which provide additional information about the element. Attributes are added inside the opening tag.

### Example:
```html
<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example</a>
<img src="image.jpg" alt="An image" width="300" height="200">
```

### Key Points:
- Common attributes include `href` (for links), `src` (for images), and `alt` (for image descriptions).
- The `target="_blank"` attribute for `<a>` opens the link in a new tab.

## 5. Lists in HTML

HTML supports both ordered and unordered lists.

### Unordered List:
```html
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
```

### Ordered List:
```html
<ol>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
</ol>
```

### Key Points:
- The `<ul>` tag creates an unordered list (bullets).
- The `<ol>` tag creates an ordered list (numbered).
- Both lists contain `<li>` elements for list items.

## 6. Links and Navigation

Links are created using the `<a>` (anchor) tag, and they allow navigation between web pages.

### Example:
```html
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
<a href="#section1">Go to Section 1</a>
```

### Key Points:
- The `href` attribute specifies the destination URL.
- Anchor links can also link to specific sections within the same page using an `id` attribute.

## 7. Images in HTML

Images are displayed using the `<img>` tag. The `src` attribute specifies the image source, and the `alt` attribute provides a description.

### Example:
```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="A description of the image">
```

### Key Points:
- The `src` attribute is used to specify the image file path.
- The `alt` attribute is important for accessibility and describes the image content.

## 8. Forms in HTML

Forms allow users to input data, such as text fields, checkboxes, and buttons. The `<form>` element contains the form controls.

### Example:
```html
<form action="/submit" method="POST">
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

### Key Points:
- The `action` attribute specifies the URL where form data will be sent.
- The `method` attribute specifies the HTTP method (e.g., GET or POST).

## 9. Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML elements provide meaning to the content they enclose, making it more accessible and easier to understand.

### Example:
```html
<header>
  <h1>Website Header</h1>
</header>
<main>
  <section>
    <h2>Section Title</h2>
    <p>Content goes here.</p>
  </section>
</main>
<footer>
  <p>Footer content</p>
</footer>
```

### Key Points:
- Semantic elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, and `<article>` help structure the document logically.
- They improve accessibility and SEO.

## 10. Conclusion

HTML is the foundation of web development and allows you to create the structure of web pages. By understanding the fundamentals of HTML, such as elements, attributes, and structure, you can begin building your own websites. HTML is often used alongside CSS and JavaScript to create fully interactive and styled web applications.

Happy coding!
