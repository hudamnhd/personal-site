## Personal

I am a Neovim enthusiast because of its simplicity and speed. I use Neovim primarily for writing code and taking notes, appreciating its lightweight and efficient design that enhances my workflow. Additionally, I use Linux with the DWM window manager on my PC. The combination of Linux and DWM is ideal for me, as it offers a minimalist environment that helps me stay focused and significantly boosts my productivity.
