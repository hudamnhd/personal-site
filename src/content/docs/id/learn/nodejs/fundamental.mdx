title: Node.js and npm Fundamentals
---

## 1. Introduction to Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, which is used in Google Chrome. Node.js is designed for building scalable network applications and is widely used for server-side development.

### Key Points:
- Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it lightweight and efficient.
- It is commonly used for building back-end services like APIs, real-time applications, and microservices.
- Node.js uses npm (Node Package Manager) for managing packages and dependencies.

## 2. Installing Node.js

You can install Node.js using different methods. One of the easiest ways to install Node.js on Linux is by using the package manager.

### Install Node.js on Debian/Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install npm
```

### Verify Installation:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

This will output the version numbers of Node.js and npm installed.

## 3. npm (Node Package Manager)

npm is the default package manager for Node.js, and it allows you to install, share, and manage packages for your Node.js projects.

### Basic npm Commands:

#### Install a Package Globally
```bash
sudo npm install -g package-name
```

#### Install a Package Locally
```bash
npm install package-name
```

#### Uninstall a Package Globally
```bash
sudo npm uninstall -g package-name
```

#### Uninstall a Package Locally
```bash
npm uninstall package-name
```

#### List Installed Packages
```bash
npm list
```

#### Create a `package.json` File
To initialize a new Node.js project and create a `package.json` file, run:
```bash
npm init
```

This will prompt you to fill out some details about the project.

#### Update npm
To update npm to the latest version, use the following command:
```bash
npm install -g npm@latest
```

## 4. Introduction to nvm (Node Version Manager)

nvm is a tool that allows you to manage multiple versions of Node.js on the same machine. It is useful when you need to switch between different versions of Node.js for different projects.

### Install nvm on Debian/Ubuntu:

1. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl
```

2. Install nvm by running the following command:
```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
```

3. Restart your terminal or source your profile:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

4. Verify nvm installation:
```bash
nvm --version
```

### Using nvm to Install and Manage Node.js Versions:

#### Install a Specific Version of Node.js
```bash
nvm install 16.13.0
```

#### Use a Specific Version of Node.js
```bash
nvm use 16.13.0
```

#### List Installed Node.js Versions
```bash
nvm ls
```

#### Set Default Node.js Version
```bash
nvm alias default 16.13.0
```

## 5. Introduction to pnpm (Performant npm)

pnpm is an alternative to npm that is faster and more efficient. It uses a unique node_modules layout that stores dependencies in a single place, which reduces disk space usage and speeds up installations.

### Install pnpm:

To install pnpm, you can use npm (once npm is installed):
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

### Basic pnpm Commands:

#### Install Dependencies Using pnpm
```bash
pnpm install
```

#### Install a Package
```bash
pnpm add package-name
```

#### Uninstall a Package
```bash
pnpm remove package-name
```

#### Update a Package
```bash
pnpm update package-name
```

#### List Installed Packages
```bash
pnpm list
```

#### Create a New Project with pnpm
```bash
pnpm init
```

## 6. Conclusion

Node.js, npm, nvm, and pnpm are essential tools for modern JavaScript development. Node.js allows for building server-side applications, while npm and pnpm help manage dependencies efficiently. nvm is particularly useful for managing multiple versions of Node.js. By mastering these tools, you'll be able to build scalable and efficient applications with ease.

Happy coding!
